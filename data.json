The solution strengthens public health and safety by enabling more effective credentialing, permitting, licensing, examination, inspection, and discipline of healthcare providers and facilities. By providing a consistent and scalable system, the project advances Maryland’s ability to regulate health professions with greater efficiency, accountability, and transparency."
